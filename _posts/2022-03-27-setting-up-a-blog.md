## Launching my personal blog
Hi, I'm Utku, an internet person located in Istanbul, Turkey.And lately, I've been contemplating different places to do blogging on. As you see, I finally locked down on an option and decided, "why not build it yourself while you're at it, your prospective employers would love it!" and built this website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
I thought it would be simple process given that **Jekyll is created by one of GitHub's cofounders** and former-CEO, [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo).

Seriously, there's even an option in your repository that promises to change your theme with a few clicks!
but it's been quite challenging to get it working on my preferred theme, [Dinky](https://github.com/pages-themes/dinky). So we're stuck with the default theme [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) for now.

### Why I ended up using Jekyll?

At first, I  tried setting up a Ruby environment on Windows, It was a hassle figuring out dependencies and getting it to execute my will. You see, Ruby is much better suited to work on MacOS and Linux,
