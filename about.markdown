## About me

Formerly working as an editor, I took the leap and took a break from working to transition into the IT field; and, as such, I’m currently educating myself on the current technologies (notably, I studied the material for CompTIA A+, without taking the exam) and the networking/security side in particular.

### Without a particular goal in sight, I have been developing my skills on several ends to figure out what I like the most:
✅Networking: Because that’s where the magic happens 

✅Several programs and working environments 👇 

 ✔️Worked on identifying analyzing real malware through LetsDefend’s SOC analyst training environment 
 
 ✔️Utilized FireEye's Redline for forensics challenges 
 
 ✔️Kali Linux to dip my toes in Linux and participate in CTFs properly. 
 
✅OSINT: Coming from a journalism background and a lifelong history of researching stuff for no reason. It also makes you a power-Googler. 


### More about me
I’m used to working in a team and interdepartmentally, the start-up way. I thrive when solving problems and can also explain and annotate my working process in a clear way that is comprehensible for everyone.

Ideally, I want to find a cyber security role, but I’m not even sure an entry-level role truly exists in this realm. so, I’m also open to an entry-level IT role such as help desk, technical success management, or software/hardware support. 

Ultimately, I'd like to go in one of these two directions. 

🎨Develop my technical side and pair it with my OSINT capabilities to become a threat intelligence analyst 
or

🎨Partake in red-teaming/pentesting with a team that utilizes social engineering
But of course, 5 years from now, I might not even end up in cybersecurity, it's hard to foresee where one will end up in IT, so who knows?
